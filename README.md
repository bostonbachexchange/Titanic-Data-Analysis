# Titanic Data Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python, pandas, seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket information, and survival status.

## Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas and seaborn
- Visualizations of key insights and relationships within the dataset
- Deployment of the analysis to GitHub Pages

## Files

- `Titanic_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code
- `Titanic_Data_Analysis.html`: HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the dependencies using pip:
